I always wanted to have my own website, however I did not want to deal with the front-end as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML coding is not something I enjoy. Especially JavaScript ðŸ¤®.

## Hugo

This website was made using Hugo, a framework made using Go. I was drawn too it as it is open-source and you don't have to interact with the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I even have the possibility in the future to completely switch the theme.
