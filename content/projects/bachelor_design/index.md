For my bachelor design project we were tasked in creating a location based augmented reality app. Thus we created UT-GO!, [which is available on the PlayStore {{< icon "playstorecolor" >}}!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.utwente.utgo) . 

## Usage by University of Twente
We are quite proud that our app has been used numerous times to show new students around the University Of Twente in an interactive manner while teaching them about our Bachelor program. 

## My responsibility
**I was responsible for the Augmented Reality**, which was quite painful as Google's AR-Core (our best option) was not supported by Google at the time. But the AR worked well in the end!
