For my bachelor design project we were tasked in creating a location based augmented reality app. Thus we created UT-GO! [available on playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.utwente.utgo). 

## Usage by University of Twente
We are quite proud that our app has been used numerous times to show new students around the University Of Twente in an interactive manner while teaching them about our Bachelor program.
