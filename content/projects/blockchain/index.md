For the project of our Blockchain course we were tasked in creating anything as long as it would use or interact with blockchains. We settled on creating a PrestoDB connector for the Tezos network. PrestoDB allows for SQL queries to be done on blockchains. So creating a PrestoDB connector would allow people to get information from the blockchain with normal SQL queries.
