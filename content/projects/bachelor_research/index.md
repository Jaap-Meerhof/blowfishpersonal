For my bachelor's assignment I chose a project that involved Reinforcement Learning. My supervisor wanted to asses the viability of a new routing system that would use routers at junctions to route around vehicles. So when arriving at a junction you can ask the router which turn you should take at that junction. The router would learn from feedback of the car when it learns if it is closer to the end target at the next router. I investigated and created different Reinforcement Learning approaches in this setting to asses which would be best.

I'm quite proud of this paper, looking back there are certainly some small things I would have done differently. But given that this is my first research project **I'm quite proud of this work** (**Grade 9.0 :research**, 8.0 :reflection).
